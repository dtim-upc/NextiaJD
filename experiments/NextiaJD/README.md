# Experiment 1: Predictive accuracy of NextiaJD

Here, we describe the steps needed to reproduce the experiments that evaluate the performance of NextiaJD.

## Prerequisites

* NextiaJD. To see how to install NextiaJD [check this page](https://github.com/dtim-upc/NextiaJD#installation). 
* The spark-submit script. You can find this script in your Spark installation under the bin folder e.g $SPARK_HOME/bin
* A testbed provided for the experiment. See [this link](https://github.com/dtim-upc/NextiaJD/tree/1.0/experiments#setting) for more information.
* [NextiaJD_experiments.jar](https://mydisk.cs.upc.edu/s/WPp7ApMzeyPc7sX/download). This JAR should be run with `spark-submit` and we will use the following classes:
    *  **NextiaJD_evaluation** will compute the predictive accuracy: generates the discovery and time execution for the testbed

## Running Predictive accuracy

To run this experiment, you need to execute the class **NextiaJD_evaluation** from the [JAR]( https://mydisk.cs.upc.edu/s/WPp7ApMzeyPc7sX/download). You can see below the parameters needed for this class.


| Parameter           | Required | Description                                                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -d, --datasets-info | True     | path to datasets info file. This file containsthe datasets names and their configuration to read them       |
| -g, --groud-truth   | True     | path to the ground truth csv file                                                                           |
| -o, --output        | True     | path to write the discovery and time results                                                                |
| -p, --path-datasets | True     | path to the folder containing all datasets                                                                  |
| -q, --query-type    | False    | The query search. There are two types:querybydataset and querybyattribute. Default value is querybydataset. |
| -t, --testbed       | False    | testbed type: XS, S, M, L. It will be used to write a suffix in the filenames generated. Default is ""      |
| -h, --help          | False    | Show help message                                                                                           |

### Run

* Go to your Spark installation under the bin folder e.g $SPARK_HOME/bin
* Open the terminal
* Run it using the below command. Note that you should replace the parameters by your own directories. The parameter `spark.driver.memory` is added to the spark-submit command since the default value could result in GC overhead limit exceeded exception.

```
spark-submit \
--class NextiaJD_evaluation \
--master local[*]  /DTIM/nextiajd-experiments.jar \
--conf spark.driver.memory=5g \
-d /DTIM/testbedXS/datasetInformation_testbedXS.csv \
-g /DTIM/testbedXS/groundTruth_testbedXS.csv \
-p /DTIM/datasets -o /DTIM/output
```
* Once the program ends. You can find the following files in the provided output directory.
    *  **NextiaJD_testbed.csv**: this file contains the discovery results and the ground truth
    *  **Nextia\_evaluation_testbed.csv**: this file contains the confusion matrix and its metrics
    *  **time_testbed.txt**: this file contains the times from the execution: pre runtime and runtime
